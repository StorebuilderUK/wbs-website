## Crush Your Competition With A Pay Monthly Website!

​

With a pay monthly website plan, you can say goodbye to expensive upfront website design fees and rest assured that you will get the great results you need and expect from your online digital marketing efforts.

It's not just paid monthly websites we offer either. You can also spread the cost of essential [search engine optimisation](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/seo-copywriting) work or run a fantastic [social media marketing](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/social-media-plans) campaign, all with a low pay monthly fee.

​

It only takes a few minutes to get started and costs you nothing to compare pay monthly website plans with us today. We'll show you why we're the best pay monthly website company in the UK and how we can make all your digital marketing dreams come true, at a fraction of the cost of our competitors (and without any up-front fees).

​

Harness the powerful benefits of an in-house [Telford website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design) team, removing the upfront cost, getting ongoing support and crushing your competition into the bargain.

​

Building a first-class website is not cheap. At the lower end of the scale, most website designers charge between £1,000-£2,000 for an essential website, and an eCommerce site is more likely to be in the region of £5,000 at the low end. That's a lot of money to layout for a web design that may not provide a substantial return on investment for many months to come.

​

### Pay Monthly Website Packages

​

After an initial consultation to ascertain your website requirements, you'll get a secure, [search engine optimised](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/seo-copywriting) bespoke website built by our expert website design team right here in Telford in the heart of the West Midlands. Take a look at our [website design portfolio](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk) for some fantastic inspiration and a tantalising glimpse of what we can produce for you.

As well as the completed web design, we'll also include making content changes, adding [professional blog writing services](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/blog-writing) and generally managing the site on your behalf.​

​

You'll not need to worry about hosting or a domain name, and as your company grows, your business website can also grow with it.

The best bit is that you can reclaim your time. If you don't understand HTML or know your. png from your. jpg, then [building a website yourself](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/10-reasons-not-to-build-your-own-website) can result in an enormous amount of lost time. You can better use that time contacting prospective new clients or improving your product or service.

### What Do I Get With My New Pay Monthly Website Plan?

​

The premise is simple - we want you to be successful, and by delivering excellent results every month, you'll never want to go anywhere else. Monthly reports are generated for your account to see the completed work, and of course, with social media marketing, the results are there for all to see.​

With pay monthly websites, you can save a ton of money and have the excellent visibility you always wanted in front of your target audience.

​

We won't surprise you with hidden costs either. All of our website designs come complete with stunning [graphic design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/graphic-design) and the set up of [essential analytics tracking tools](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/your-introduction-to-google-analytics) and forms so that you have a fully functioning lead generator or [eCommerce website](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/ecommerce-website-design-telford) as soon as it goes live.​

​

### How Do I Get Started?

​

In the same way that you get a Sky or Virgin satellite TV plan, our pay monthly websites work similarly. 

In 3 simple steps:

 1. Submit your application, and we'll be in touch within 24 hours to discuss your requirements further. We provide a no-obligation quote at this stage based on what you want to achieve from your website.

 2. If you're happy, we'll proceed with the setup process, which takes around seven days from start to finish, and then we'll have a go-live date for your site. No matter what time of day or night you decide to launch, we've got it covered!

 3. Once your site is live with your domain name; we'll have a digital marketing strategy in place to give you the best results possible. Of course, you want more traffic (leads and conversions), more money coming in the door (to make it even easier for you to drive more traffic) or both!

### Bespoke Websites, SEO and Social Media Marketing

​

Under our pay monthly website plans, you only pay for the website you want, and it's not one design fits all, meaning you can keep things simple but drive more traffic to your site without extra costs.

​

We consult with you on search terms you wish to be discovered for, and using the latest search engine marketing techniques, we ensure you always have the best chance of [ranking at the top of the pile](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/product-page/90-day-seo-plan).

Social media is just as important now as getting your site live, so we'll include Twitter, Facebook and Google with every pay monthly website plan. We post content relevant to your business on these social channels and ensure you gain as many fans and followers as possible.

​

### Matching Your Website To Your Existing Business

​

We know every business website is different, so we tailor each new pay monthly website plan to suit your business. We'll ensure you get what your business website needs, from a single-page site with social media to an eCommerce site complete with thousands of products.

​

So, when we say pay monthly website plans, we mean it! There are no long-term contracts to sign, and if at any point you feel like you aren't getting what you want (and deserve), let us know, and we'll sort something out for you.

### ​

### Paying Monthly For Web Design Means Ongoing Support

​

A website where you pay monthly means there is no need to take a chance that you'll get the website design your business deserves. You'll know that the work is being done correctly and to a high standard by paying monthly to take your business online.

​

Ongoing Support

## ​Why Traditional Web Design Companies Are So Expensive

​

The main problem with website design lies not in the finished product but in how the search engines (primarily Google) function. It is usually a good three months from site launch until you begin to see any good traffic from organic search, and that also depends on how well your content performs and your external linking strategy.

​

When you begin fleshing out your cash flow spreadsheet, a new website design is going to put you in the red very quickly!

Pay monthly websites mean you are not committing to the entire project upfront, instead only paying once created and providing you with an immediately implemented finished product.

The idea behind premium pay monthly websites is not a new one but the concept of providing website design as a service is gaining popularity. There is not much to gain from commissioning a new website unless you promote it actively and consistently improve it. The competition is always working towards a better iteration of their product.

### ​

### How Does A Pay Per Month Website Plan Work?

​

There is no setup fee and upfront charges, so your outlay is minimal. The contract length is 12 months, which means that you can spread the cost over a financial year and reclaim our expenditure over the same period.

​

This pay monthly website plan is ideal for businesses struggling to get a great web design, and paying monthly enables you to spread the cost. Meaning that you spend minimal cash upfront and can spread your payments right through the year - it really couldn't be simpler.

By the time you have invested fully, you will have a great looking website and a thriving eCommerce business, all built by our talented web designers here in Telford, Shropshire, and without spending heavily upfront on internet technology. It is a win/win proposition.

## ​

### Why Don't I Build A Website Myself?

​

Modern website building tools are becoming more sophisticated and easier to use than ever before. It's easy to build a website for a small business, but making it look presentable to your clients or potential customers is a whole other ball game.

​

I know this because the first website I built was website builder reviews, where I reviewed all the best tools for making an eCommerce website. I had frequent requests to provide extra services like [logo design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/logo-design) and social media marketing. In the end, the demand got so big that I built this [website design agency!​](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk)

Using a drag and drop website builder (for example, [Wix website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/wix-website-design), Weebly) makes the [website development](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-development) and creation process straightforward. The problem for you is that you don't have an eye for detail or any photoshop skills, let alone an understanding of basic design concepts like white space or font kerning.

Many [Shopify eCommerce sites](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/ecommerce-website-design-telford) are built from the same template and look the same, and owners don't have the design skills to modify them.

[DIY website builders](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/ecommerce-website-builder-platforms-explained) are great if you appreciate design, but you need more than amateur chops for the gig if you want to elevate yourself above the competition.​

Pay monthly websites do a fantastic job of filling the marketplace gap between those trying to bootstrap their way to success on a shoestring and higher-end websites costing tens of thousands of pounds.

### How To Build An eCommerce Website – Project Management Guide

## ​

The more people involved in an eCommerce website builder project, the harder it is to get the project across the line on deadline day. Once multiple stakeholders and their egos' are involved, expertly managing the project becomes essential.

### What Extra Features Does My Pay Monthly Website Have?

​

If you have an existing logo design, then we can, of course, incorporate that into your web design. Still, we include a fantastic brand new logo design with your pay monthly website package for everyone else who hasn't got that far yet.

​

Your pay monthly website comes with everything you expect from a first-class website design agency. Including a free domain name, live chat, a booking and event calendar system, full eCommerce functionality, social media share icons, SEO friendly and hosting all included. Did I mention you'll also get a free domain name added as well?

All pay monthly websites are fully mobile responsive, meaning they will look great on all mobile devices and tablets as well as a desktop, and you can also control the mobile layout separately if you wish.​

​

We include ongoing support costs, so there are no additional monthly maintenance charges. All pay monthly websites come with search engine optimisation right from day one.

We add your site to the Google search console, create a sitemap, and fully optimise page titles and descriptions. Google analytics tracking comes as standard.

## Can you build eCommerce websites on monthly paid plans?

​Absolutely! Depending on the type of eCommerce website you want to produce, we can either use our in-house content management system with an eCommerce bolt-on or use an existing platform like EKM or Shopify as a basis for your [eCommerce web design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/ecommerce-website-design-telford). After all, there is no point in reinventing the wheel!

### Can You replace my website with a bespoke website design?

People often ask whether a new website can replace or remake their existing website. To help you answer this question yourself, I have put together a list of pros and cons.

The Pros of Remaking your existing site:

You don't have to spend time learning new tools or updating skills - you know this site inside out already, so it's not difficult to use the same content structure for a unique design. You can use all of your existing content - if it's better than what you have in the design, then you're starting from a reasonable point.

The Cons of Remaking your existing site:

It might be challenging to work with your current CMS - maybe some plugins don't play nice with newer versions, or it might be full of orphaned content. You might not get the results that you want - this is especially true if there are some fundamental flaws in your site's structure.

​The Pros of Building a New Website:

A new website design will be future-proof - better for SEO, more modern, and able to take advantage of new web technologies as they emerge. Everything can be set up from scratch - or near enough as it makes no difference, saving time messing about with the existing site.

The Cons of Building a New Website:

It's difficult to maintain if you're not familiar with it - every site will require maintenance and updates as new elements get added to your site; an existing location is more convenient because you already know how it works. You need to spend time learning new tools - if pages and content use elements of the design that you're not familiar with, you'll have to know them before building your site.

## Crush Your Competition With A Pay Monthly Website Design

The problem with investing in information technology is that it's so damn expensive. It seems like every time you spend on something new, a better version gets released the week after.

In the case of computer hardware, then the only option you have to run the latest processing technology is out with the old and in with the new. But with the development of SAAS (software as a service) upgrading those devices "from the cloud" with the latest software is an automatic process.

SAAS is what happens when the Apps or Android system get updated on your smartphone, and you may use SAAS applications in your company like [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com), [Slack](https://www.slack.com) or [Docusign](https://www.docusign.com) all of which you pay a monthly subscription for. We've come a long way since the days of using CD copying tools like Ghost to set up our company computer networks, and I'm old enough to remember them!

Crush Your Competition

### How You View Investment In Website Design

I'm going to ask you to change how you view your [investment in website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/the-cost-of-building-a-website-how-to-get-an-accurate-quote). A new p[ay monthly website](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk) could be the complete solution to all your internet marketing woes.

You see, the traditional way of working in software development is that you pay a deposit upfront, say 50% of the total price, and then hand over the balance when the project is complete. Larger projects can be split into multiple "milestones" with recurring payments made as each milestone is reached.

I've built many websites for clients, but after taking full payment, a recurring theme was that the site would slowly grow stale because the owner wasn't capable of marketing it. [Website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design) is one small part of the bigger picture – how do you get your customer to part with their three-digit security code?

### It was frustrating to see so much money spent on the design and so little on the marketing. Then, at last, it dawned on me...

Building a website and leaving the client to figure out the marketing is like giving them the expensive exhibition stand but no staff to man it. It looks fantastic, but you'll never sell anything until you create a dialogue to engage with the customer.

That's when I realised that charging for website design is a lose/lose proposition. If I take your £3,000 and build you an eCommerce website that barely makes you any revenue, how would you feel about that? You lose, because you've spent a lot of money that you are unlikely to recoup, and I miss out because I can't upsell you to other digital marketing services.

To be able to convert customers into buyers, you have to be able to generate traffic to your website and also understand Google analytics enough so that you can build out landing pages and design email campaigns that work. Without this part, your website design on its own is useless.

There's a catch though. To be able to build a website that establishes credibility AND generates enough traffic to make it viable is a lot more expensive than just website design on its own. I have a great blog post that goes into specific cost detail if you want to know more about the [cost of building a website](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/the-cost-of-building-a-website-how-to-get-an-accurate-quote).

## Creating A WIN/WIN Solution

The way that Google works means that established websites are given higher ranking precedence over newer ones. This is because newer sites have less content and fewer citations to make them worthy of ranking. In general, it takes three to six months before your new website starts to appear for any search terms.

If the upfront cost of your new website is £3,000 then that's six months you'll have to wait until you see any action at all in your bank account. And if you don't do any [search engine optimisation](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/seo-copywriting) or [social media marketing](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/social-media-plans) work then, unfortunately, you'll probably never see any revenue at all, which is why pay monthly websites make complete sense.

[![The cost of building a website](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b0d63a_5559eca5913f42338c2740829878ff5a~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_331,h_188,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/Blog-740-420-Cost-Building-Website-01.jpg)](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/the-cost-of-building-a-website-how-to-get-an-accurate-quote)

## The Cost Of Building A Website – How To Get An Accurate Quote

## ​

Before you start commissioning a new website design you want to know how much it is going to cost, but before I give you the in-depth answer let me ask you a different rhetorical question – how much is a new car?

[Read The Blog Post](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/the-cost-of-building-a-website-how-to-get-an-accurate-quote)

## Here's The Bottom Line...

To make things as simple as possible for you, I've split up the separate components of building a website into easily manageable [pay monthly plans](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/plans-pricing) so that you can pick and choose which [website development services](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-development) you need. So, for example, a brand new site would pick both the website design and the SEO component to run together for a total cost of £500 per month.

## If that sounds like a lot then consider this because it's the key take-away:

By the time you get to the six-month-old mark, you'll have invested £3,000 in your new pay monthly website, the same as if you'd spent all your budget upfront with a traditional digital agency. Only this time you'll also have six months of SEO and marketing into the bargain under your belt so traffic will be on the increase.

You'll have a much better chance of establishing a viable business by taking this two-pronged approach. Also, how often do you visit your favourite website and see that they've had a redesign or improved some of their features? It happens all the time, right? The reason is that by studying visitor behaviour patterns and statistics, you can create a better mousetrap or "sales funnel".

But you can only do this if you have current traffic statistics to analyse. So it's a catch 22. Without any visitor statistics to analyse, you can't improve the sales funnel, which is why it is essential to begin marketing your website at the same time you start building it.

By paying monthly, you ease the financial burden in the early stages when you have little or no website traffic and can then later "grease the wheels" as you pick up speed, continually improving and refining your sales pitch. Sounds pretty good right?

Now that I've given you the secret to crushing your competition [contact us](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/contact) and we'll help you dominate your marketplace.
