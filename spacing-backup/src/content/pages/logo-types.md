# WHICH IS BEST FOR YOU?

# Deciding which logo is best for you is not always a straightforward task and even though you might start searching for a particular type, oftentimes the one you end up selecting is a different style altogether and this is generally because you unexpectedly come across something that has instant appeal. A style or format that literally just catches your eye. 
 
You could almost compare the process to that of finding a life partner because setting out with a plan to find a particular type of person with a specific character is invariably thrown out the proverbial window when you happen to meet "the one" and it has been our experience that providing samples of various logo designs is a more productive way of determining which style appeals to our clients. 

# START OUT WITH A PLAN

# Of course, you can set out with some basic principles by searching for a type that reflects the image of your company in a style that is "generally accepted" as suitable for your industry, for example; Lettermark or Wordmark might generally work best for a bank or funeral services company but this is not always the case, in fact, nowadays it is not always the norm. 
 
SIMPLE IS BEST 
In recent years, simple designs have universally been accepted as the best approach for logos, with only a few exceptions (such as the Starbucks logo) and in this partly explains the popularity of flat design and negative space logos. As designers, we have almost been programmed and conditioned (almost brainwashed) into this mindset and we tend to automatically assume that clients are looking for this type of design but, as with all things, this is not always the case. 
 
Once again this further indicates that the best approach is to display a selection of styles and let the viewer decide which has the most appeal. 

# OUR MOST POPULAR LOGOS

# From our perspective, the most frequently commissioned logos are Combination and Emblem (no's 6 and 7 above) but we are not advocating one style over another and there are numerous studies that inform the psychology and effects of imagery and text combinations on the conscious and subconscious mind. We are not trying to represent or comment on such research but instead simply want to let our clients know that if you have a particular style in mind, we can do that and if you are not really sure what you are looking for, we can accommodate that too.
