# Small Business Website Design Services To Melt Your Clients Hearts

 * Nov 23, 2021


It's not just about the web design, you know. Of course, having a suited and booted website ready to go out on a first date is going to make a fantastic first impression.

 
But there's more to seducing a customer than good looks alone. In this article, I'm going to introduce you to three [_web design services_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/) you can use to stoke the fire and ignite the flames of your fledgling customer relationship.

 
First off, a word about small business website design. Before you go spending thousands of pounds on creating a new small business website, consider that what the customer sees is the tip of the iceberg, and gaining their attention in the first place takes a lot of unnoticed effort.

 
Just as getting ready for your prom date can take hours to make sure everything is ideally in place, making that first impression, whilst essential, is not going to count for much if you can't back it up with some substance in the conversation department.

 
[_Paying monthly for website design_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/pay-monthly-websites) makes complete sense because you are freeing up cash for other, less glamourous, [_website development services_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-development) that nevertheless make up an essential part of your customer overture.

 
Here are three small business website design services that will engage your potential clients and stare warmly into their loving eyes.

 
## A Regularly Updated Blog

## 

Keeping your blog fresh and active is essential for any business website, regardless of the size. It's crucial to include blog posts on your website and integrate with social media because your business website reflects who you are, and for the customer, reading a blog can be like staring into the soul of its creator.

 
**Show your visitors that you care by providing the most informative and helpful information.**

 
A blog can provide a community for website visitors to interact through the comments section, establishing an online business presence that can boost your [_small business website_](https://wildwooddigital.co.uk/websites-for-tradespeople/) traffic and improve your branding. It will also show that you have customers who care about what you do as much as you do.

 
Establish yourself as an expert in your business industry by sharing relevant content - information about trends, updates, events, and other newsworthy topics applicable within your business context.

 
Your business blog can be an effective powerful platform in establishing your business as the go-to company in the appropriate industry. The more quality content you provide about your company, the greater exposure you get.

 
### How Often Should I blog?

The best way is to start producing one blog post a week and commit to it, which is enough to start gaining traction with search engines and ease you into writing regularly, which can be a bit daunting at first.

 
In today's world, blogging has become one of the most popular ways for businesses - large and small - to market themselves online because blogging is free and easy! If you're interested in blogging but don't know how or where to start, then check out our [_professional blogging services_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/blog-writing).

 
## Producing A Monthly Newsletter

Producing a newsletter for your customers is an excellent way of letting them know about your small business services.

 
There are many benefits to email marketing, and an email newsletter can be a great way of communicating important information and getting your business noticed.

 
A timely topic will help the reader feel like they are receiving something useful, and because it's short and easy to read, it will encourage them to take action before moving on.

 
Because you only have a few seconds for someone to read what you've written, brevity is essential. Every word must work hard: each sentence needs a clear purpose and should be interesting enough that people want to keep reading until the end.

 
You should also include one or two photos to humanise the monthly newsletter and take the time to create a great hero image. Ensure your images are high-resolution and in focus; if you publish anything blurry, your audience will immediately delete it, so don't give them a bad user experience.

 
The monthly newsletter is also a great way to break up any promotional content with helpful information like industry news, tips about how your products could be used (especially for online retailers), or changes in legislation. 

 
Many customers prefer to read short articles rather than watch [_business promotional videos_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/promotional-videos) for this reason, so long as you can present everything enough that people understand what's going on without being bored.

 
Promotional content doesn't have to take over the exclusive monthly newsletter either: try using half of each newsletter for marketing material and the other half for regular monthly content.

 
## Social Media Marketing


[_Social media marketing_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/social-media-plans) may seem like an unnecessary expense for most small businesses, but it can help you stay connected with existing customers and find new ones when used effectively.

 
For example, if you own a children's clothing store, social media can be a great place to show off your adorable clothes and their social media profiles. There's also the opportunity for social commerce - using social media platforms to not only market your brand but sell products as well.

 
For larger companies, social media marketing is even more critical since social networking sites offer ways to connect with your customers on an individual level- something that traditional ads can't do. 

 
A great example of this is Oreo, who used social media marketing in 2013 during a power outage at the Super Bowl by tweeting an image of an Oreo cookie with the caption "You can still dunk in the dark."

 
This clever tweet was shared over 15,000 times. It also showed that Oreos were versatile enough to survive a blackout. Whatever social platform your business decides to use, social media marketing can be a great way to connect with customers, build brand awareness and promote new products.

 
## To Summarise

I've given you three great ways to engage with your customer and begin to tug on the purse strings of their hard-earned cash. Building a website is just the start of a long journey into understanding your customer and pressing their buttons in the right order so that they feel good parting with their money.

 
Any one of these website design services can easily cost more annually than the cost of an initial website design, but that's the price of driving high customer engagement. You can't be the father of the bride and get out of this world without having your wallet emptied.
