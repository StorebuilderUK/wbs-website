## Custom Web Development

Generate business solutions with our software development processes.

Most situations demand a specific solution and custom web development plugs the gap when an off the peg solution will not suffice. 

​

The custom website build will be tailored to you alone - no pre-existing templates or drag and drop tools, meaning a user experience developed from the ground up and tailored towards your target audience.

​

When you order a custom-built website, you avoid bloatware and superfluities that pad out the page and don't serve any purpose.

 
We will provide you with a custom experience representing your brand and delivering the message you want to convey. It might even lead to better search engine ranking.

​

The custom design approach means we can look at things holistically, evaluate all aspects of the website and its content, and ensure what we build effectively meshes with users' needs and expectations.

​

It's important not to lose sight of your target audience throughout this process: custom development helps us prioritise their wants and needs over arbitrary design choices.

## Web App Development

Our web app development team produces web applications that are easy to use and are secure. 

 
Web App development has different methods of creation depending on the target platform.

​

Front-End web app development uses web standards such as HTML5 and CSS3. We use this web design technology for making websites that work well with mobile devices.

​

Client-side web app development creates web applications where the web browser serves as the entire user interface, this web design increases performance and makes web apps scalable.

​

We use JavaScript libraries like backbone or angular js for client-side web application development, which gives our team more time to build web applications that use web standards and plugins like jquery.

​

Web application code is written in different programming languages like Ruby On Rails or Python, depending on what we need to do for a particular web application.

​

We always use frameworks like Rails and Django to make our job easier and faster to focus more of our time creating beautiful web designs with rich content.

​

The web application development team is here for all your custom software development needs and to help you design your web applications to be easy to use, secure and scaleable.
