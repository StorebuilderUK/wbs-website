## Blend Text And Images Effortlessly For A Smooth Look
## 
Website design and graphic design are two very different beasts.
Graphic designers have to worry about the placement and styling of images, while website designers need to optimise text for the web.
However, when the two crafts come together, website designers can create visually stunning pages that are easy to read and navigate.
Website designers take the following into account when working on your website page:
 1. Using the same font throughout a page, creating a unified look and feel.
 2. Choosing complementary colours for your text and images.
 3. Sizing images and text appropriately.
 4. Bolding specific keywords to highlight their importance.
 5. Using single spaces between each paragraph for easy reading.
 6. Combining colour schemes for easy harmonious contrast.
 7. Creating pop art backgrounds with strategically placed dramatic images and layers of colour behind your website design or text to create dimension.
Using these style rules you can create beautiful websites that are easy on the eye.
But remember that the rules are always meant to be broken and an expert creative marketing agency can make all the difference to your production.
## Get Noticed On Social Media And Gain Followers
A graphic designer will help you get noticed by potential customers on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.
To get started, you will need to choose social media platforms relevant to your business. Do your research on social media demographics to determine who your target customers are and what social sites they use the most.
Then, determine how social media is essential to achieving your goals with marketing. For example, if social media is a new platform for you, but you want it to be part of your social media marketing strategy, then this would assist in getting noticed by potential customers through social sharing.
A professional graphic designer can help you design social media visuals on-brand, eye-catching, and engaging.
They can also help you write social media posts that will catch your target customers’ attention.
Additionally, they can provide tips on optimising your social media profiles for search engine visibility. Working with a professional graphic designer can ensure that your social media marketing efforts are effective and efficient.
