## Are You Looking For A New Wix Website Design?

We offer a full range of Wix [website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design) services to help your business thrive and prosper. We have helped many companies use the Wix platform to produce beautiful and functional websites as a Wix partner.
A Wix website is a fantastic platform for businesses offering everything you need to get online and grow your business. With Wix, you can create a website within hours without touching a line of code. Although having an eye for design or some photoshop skills is highly desirable!
Wix templates and websites are mobile-friendly and SEO-ready out of the box. You can use the built-in tools to create many different types of small business websites, for example, garages, hair salons and wedding planner websites.
Wix is great for artists, painters, singers, bands, and those who need to showcase a portfolio.
### Why Choose The Wix Website Platform?

The Wix website platform uses a drag-and-drop interface, so you don't need to know any code, and you can make relatively complex website design layouts with different background sections and multiple layers.
Quickly adding images and [business promotion videos](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/promotional-videos) to a page is a breeze, and all the page elements can be placed on the page individually with the drag-and-drop editor.
A lot easier than trying to accomplish complex website designs with HTML DIV tags!
If you're looking for a simple way to build a beautiful website to help you grow your business, Wix is the perfect platform for you and our Wix pricing UK is fantastic value for money!
