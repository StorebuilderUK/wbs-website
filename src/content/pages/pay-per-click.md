## Frequently Asked Questions

**How much should I budget for PPC?**
It depends on your market and goals. We typically recommend starting with £500-1,000/month to gather data, then scaling based on results.

**How quickly will I see results?**
Unlike SEO, PPC delivers immediate visibility. You'll start getting clicks within hours of launch, though optimisation for best ROI takes 4-6 weeks.

**Can I manage PPC myself?**
While platforms make it easy to spend money, effective PPC management requires expertise. Poor management often costs more than professional fees.

**Do you require contracts?**
No long-term contracts. We recommend a 3-month minimum to properly optimise campaigns, but you can pause or stop anytime with 30 days notice.

**What's your success rate?**
We typically achieve 20-50% reduction in cost-per-lead within the first 90 days while increasing lead quality. Results vary by industry and competition.
