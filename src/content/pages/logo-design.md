## What Makes a Great Logo?

### The Five Principles We Follow

**1. Simplicity**
The best logos are simple enough to draw from memory. Think Apple, Nike, McDonald's.

**2. Versatility**
Your logo must work everywhere - from a tiny social media icon to a massive billboard.

**3. Relevance**
It should connect with your target audience and reflect your industry without being cliché.

**4. Memorability**
Great logos stick in the mind. They're unique enough to stand out but simple enough to remember.

**5. Timelessness**
Avoid trendy designs that will look dated in a few years. Aim for longevity.
