### How does Magento work?

## 
Magento is a highly complex PHP eCommerce platform that runs on a MySQL database at its core. It uses the Zend Framework, which is a collection of PHP libraries. Magento also utilises a flexible shopping cart system as part of its content management system within the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
Magento 2 is the latest version of Magento. It includes many significant improvements over Magento 1. x, including a new architecture, a new templating system, and improved performance.

## Experienced Magento Web Development Agency
When you're ready to start designing your Magento website, choosing an experienced Magento development company, like our Magento web design and development services team, is crucial.
At We Build Stores, we have a team of Magento specialists based in the UK who can help you create a beautiful website using the Magento platform that is easy to use and helps you sell more products.
One of the most important aspects to consider is the [website design](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design). The look and feel of your storefront will play a significant role in how successful your store is, so it's essential to take the time to get it right.
When designing your Magento storefront, there are a few things to keep in mind:
First, you'll need to choose a theme that matches your brand's overall look and feel. Several great Magento themes are available, so take some time to browse through them and find one that fits your style.
Once you've chosen a theme, you must set up your pages. Magento Commerce offers several different page types, so you'll need to decide which ones to use and how to arrange them.
Some essential pages to consider are the home page, the product pages, the category pages, and the checkout page.
Each of these pages has a specific purpose, so it's essential to optimise them to make it easy for visitors to find what they're looking for and complete their purchase.
Finally, don't forget about your mobile store. With more and more people shopping on their smartphones and tablets, it's vital to have a mobile-friendly storefront. Luckily, Magento themes are typically responsive, so they should adjust to fit any screen size.
However, it's still important to test your site on different devices and ensure that it looks and performs well.

### Optimising Your Magento Store

If you're running a Magento store, there are several things you can do to optimise the design and improve the user experience. In this quick guide, I'll cover some of the critical areas.
### 1\. Make sure your Magento website design is responsive
These days, it's essential that you responsively design your website to look good and function correctly on all devices. Customers will be using various devices to visit your store - from desktop computers to laptops, tablets and smartphones - so your site must be accessible and easy to use.
There are a few things you can do to ensure your site is responsive:
 * Use a responsive template or design
 * Use a responsive plugin or extension
 * Use a responsive theme
### 2\. Optimise your images
If you want to optimise the speed and performance of your Magento store, you need to pay attention to the size and quality of your images.
Large, high-resolution images can slow down your site and cause loading problems for customers.
You can reduce the size of your images without sacrificing quality by using image compression tools. Several free and paid options are available, such as TinyJPG and JPEGmini.
### 3\. Use CSS sprites
Combine multiple images into a single file, reducing the number of HTTP requests when a user visits your site and improving the loading time.
### 4\. Minify your CSS and JavaScript
Minifying your CSS and JavaScript files can also help improve your Magento store's loading speed. Minification removes unnecessary characters from code, such as white space, comments and formatting, reducing the file size and making it easier for browsers to process.
You can manually minify your CSS and JavaScript files or use a tool like Grunt or Gulp.
### 5\. Use a content delivery network (CDN)
A content delivery network (CDN)is a network of servers that hosts copies of your website's files, improving the loading time for customers by serving the files from a location close to them.
Some free and paid CDN services are available, such as Cloudflare and Amazon Cloudfront.
### 6\. Optimise your Magento store settings
There are several settings you can tweak in Magento to improve the performance and design of your store. Some of these include:
 * Number of products displayed on each page
 * Number of images shown per product
 * The grid layout or list layout for category pages
 * Number of search results displayed per page
 * The sorting order for products
 * Number of products in the shopping cart cache
Optimising your store settings can improve your site's overall usability and performance.
### 7\. Use a caching plugin
Caching is a process that stores a copy of your website's files on the user's computer, speeding up the loading time for returning visitors, as they will not need to download the files again.
Several caching plugins are available for Magento, such as W3 Total Cache and MageCache. These plugins help speed up your pages' loading time by caching all or part of your website.
### 8\. Optimise your Magento database
The Magento database stores all of the data for your store, including product information, customer data and order history.
If you want to optimise the performance of your Magento store, you need to keep your database clean and organised.
You can use Magento's built-in tools to clean up and optimise your database. Or, you can use a tool like phpMyAdmin to manage your database manually.
### 9\. Use SSL encryption
SSL encryption is a security protocol that helps protect your customers' data privacy. It encrypts all communications between the customer's browser and your server so that no one can intercept the data or steal their information.
You can enable SSL encryption on your Magento store by purchasing an SSL certificate and setting it up on your server. Once SSL is enabled, you should ensure that you serve all of your store's pages over HTTPS.
### 10\. Keep Magento up to date
Magento releases new versions of its software regularly. These updates usually include bug fixes, security patches, and new features and improvements.
It's critical to keep Magento up to date to ensure that your store is secure and running smoothly.
