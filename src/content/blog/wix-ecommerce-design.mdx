## What Are The Benefits Of Using Wix for eCommerce Design?

Wix offers easy-to-use templates, drag-and-drop design features, secure payment gateways, SEO tools, and mobile responsiveness. With Wix ecommerce design, small businesses can create professional-looking online stores quickly and affordably, helping them attract customers and boost sales effectively.

If you're a small business owner contemplating stepping into the world of e-commerce and online business, this blog post will help you to understand the Wix eCommerce website builder. Here at We Build Stores, we specialise in crafting stunning, high-converting websites for small businesses, and there's one platform we swear by: Wix.

Yes, our website is built on Wix, and we trust it so much that it's the website design platform we always recommend first for our clients. In this post, I'll share why we believe Wix is the ideal e-commerce solution for small businesses and how it can help you grow your online store with ease and confidence, ensuring a good website design for eCommerce.

## Trust the Platform We Use Ourselves

When I launched We Build Stores, I could have chosen any platform—WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, you name it. But I decided on Wix. Not just because it's easy to use (though it is) but because it provides the perfect blend of flexibility, affordability, and powerful features that small businesses need.

I've been in the industry for years and have seen website design platforms evolve and sometimes wither and die. Still, Wix consistently impresses me with its user-centric updates, design versatility, and comprehensive tools tailored for small business owners.

## Simplicity: Providing a User-Friendly Experience to All Users

A common concern I hear from business owners, especially those who need to be more tech-savvy, is that setting up an online store feels overwhelming.

Believe me, I get it. Most of our clients are in the 40-70 age range and didn't grow up with digital technology. The idea of managing a website can feel like learning a new language.

But this is where Wix truly shines.

Wix's drag-and-drop interface is not only intuitive but also empowering. You don't need to know how to code or have a computer science degree to build a professional-looking website.

I've had clients who were initially intimidated by the idea of managing their own site, but after a short walkthrough, they were confidently adding new products, updating content, and customising their store's design.

Wix takes the intimidation out of website management and gives you control over your online presence in a manageable and fun way.

## Affordability: A Powerful Platform That Won't Break the Bank

Let's talk finances. For many small businesses, cost is a significant factor when choosing a successful ecommerce website platform—and it should be.

I've been there—I know what it's like to scrutinise every expense to ensure it delivers real value. Wix offers several pricing plans that cater to different needs and budgets, from those just starting to well-established businesses ready to scale.

With Wix, you won't have to worry about hidden fees sneaking up on you. The pricing is transparent, and you get a lot of bang for your buck. Even the most basic plan includes a free domain for the first year, secure hosting, and customer support.

As your business grows, you can easily upgrade to a more advanced plan that includes automated sales tax, shipping tools, and priority customer care. This flexibility means you can start small and scale up as your business expands—without the stress of escalating costs.

## Design Flexibility: Create a Store That Reflects Your Brand

One aspect I love about Wix is its design flexibility. For designers, having creative freedom is essential.

I've worked with many platforms, and some could be more open regarding design. Not Wix. Whether you're looking for a clean, minimalist look or a bold, image-heavy store, Wix provides hundreds of beautifully crafted templates that are fully customisable.

The drag-and-drop builder lets you place elements exactly where you want them. You can change fonts, colours, images, and layouts to match your brand's identity perfectly. With Wix, you get creative freedom right out of the box, allowing you to bring your unique vision to life without compromise.

And the best part? You can do all of this without writing a single line of code. You don't need to hire a team of developers or spend months learning a complicated system. With Wix, you get creative freedom right out of the box.

## Powerful E-Commerce Tools Wix Has to Offer

One of the reasons I'm so passionate about Wix is that it offers a full suite of e-commerce tools that make running an online store not just possible but efficient and enjoyable.

I've worked with many e-commerce platforms, and what sets Wix ecommerce design apart is its level of control and flexibility to small business owners—all without needing a team of developers.

Let's dive into some key e-commerce features that make Wix stand out for building an online store.

### Wix Stores: The Heart of Wix eCommerce Design

The Wix Stores app is at the core of Wix's e-commerce capability. This powerful tool provides all the essential basic ecommerce features to set up, manage, and grow an online store.

When we build a Wix website for a client, we use Wix Stores to create a seamless e-commerce experience that is user-friendly and packed with a wide range of products and functionalities.

From adding products and managing inventory to setting up payment methods and configuring shipping options, Wix Stores gives you everything needed to start selling immediately.

And don't worry—we handle all the technical setup to ensure your store is ready to go from day one.

### Effortless Product Management

Managing products can be daunting for many small business owners, but Wix makes it incredibly straightforward.

You can add an unlimited number of products—whether they're physical items, digital downloads, or services. You can organise products into categories for easy browsing and add variations like size and colour.

Wix also helps you track inventory levels, ensuring you never accidentally oversell and disappoint a customer. Each product page is fully customisable, allowing you to add high-quality images, detailed descriptions, and SEO-friendly tags to help your products stand out and rank better on search engines.

### Flexible Payment Solutions

Let's face it: an online store is only as good as its ability to get paid. Wix understands this, which is why it supports a variety of payment gateways to cater to different customer preferences.

You can integrate popular payment options like PayPal, Stripe, and Wix Payments. Wix Payments offers a smooth checkout experience and supports multiple currencies, making it an excellent choice for businesses looking to reach a broader audience through effective web design.

We set all this up for you, so you don't have to worry about the technicalities—focus on getting those sales!

### Shipping and Tax Management Made Simple

Shipping logistics and tax compliance can be a headache for any business owner, but Wix simplifies these processes with easy-to-configure built-in tools.

You can set custom shipping rules, rates, and delivery options based on your business's needs. Whether you want free shipping, flat rates, or rates calculated in real-time based on carrier fees, Wix has you covered.

Additionally, Wix can automatically calculate sales taxes for each order, helping you comply with local laws and avoid unpleasant surprises. We handle all the setup to ensure everything runs smoothly.

## Enhancing Customer Experience with Advanced E-Commerce Tools

Wix isn't just about getting your store online; it's about enhancing the customer experience and providing an engaging user experience that drives more sales. With Wix, you can create a customised shopping experience that keeps customers engaged and encourages them to buy.

Features like wishlists, product filters, and advanced search functionalities help customers find exactly what they want. Personalised product recommendations and "related products" displays can significantly boost your average order value.

We implement these features thoughtfully, ensuring they align with your brand and business goals.

### Recover Lost Sales with Abandoned Cart Recovery

Suppose you've shopped online and added items to your shopping carts only to leave without buying. You know how standard abandoned carts are. Wix's abandoned cart recovery feature automatically sends reminder emails to customers who have left items in their shopping carts without completing a purchase.

It's a powerful tool to nudge potential buyers back to your store, monitor stock levels of top products, and it works by creating a sense of urgency. We set up these automated emails for you so that you can recover potentially lost revenue with minimal effort.

### Build Customer Loyalty with Accounts and Loyalty Programs

Building a loyal customer base is crucial for long-term business success, and Wix makes this easy by allowing you to create customer accounts and loyalty programs.

Customers can create accounts to track their order history and manage their details, making repeat purchases more convenient.

You can also set up loyalty programs that reward repeat customers with discounts or exclusive offers. These programs are fantastic for encouraging customer retention and increasing customer lifetime value.

We help you design and implement these features to fit seamlessly with your business strategy.

## Marketing and SEO Tools to Boost Sales

Marketing is vital to driving traffic and increasing sales, and Wix doesn't leave you hanging here. The platform has powerful built-in marketing tools, from SEO to email marketing, that simplify promoting your store, including AI product descriptions that enhance your promotional efforts.

**Wix SEO Wiz and SEO Tools:** Ranking higher on search engines is critical for driving organic traffic to your store. Wix's SEO Wiz provides a personalised SEO plan for your site. We use these tools to optimise product pages with targeted keywords, meta tags, and clean URL structures, ensuring your store is set up for SEO success.

**Email Marketing Integration:** Keeping in touch with your customers is a great way to drive repeat business, and Wix's email marketing tools make this easy. You can create professional-looking email campaigns, send newsletters, announce new products, and offer promotions from the same platform. We handle the setup and management, so you don't have to worry about the details.

**Social Media Integration:** Social media is essential to any modern marketing strategy. Wix allows you to integrate your online store with your social media profiles, enabling you to showcase products and drive traffic back to your site. We help you connect your social channels and create a cohesive strategy leveraging your website and social media presence.

## Manage Your E-commerce Business on the Go

Running a business is free from sitting behind a desk, so Wix offers a mobile app to manage your store from anywhere. You can add new products, fulfil orders, track sales, and communicate with customers directly from your smartphone.

This flexibility is invaluable for small business owners who are always on the move. We guide you through setting up and using the Wix mobile app so you can stay on top of your business no matter where you are.

## Stay Informed with Real-Time Analytics

Understanding how your store is performing is key to making smart business decisions. Wix provides real-time analytics that gives deep insights into website traffic, sales trends, and customer behaviour.

This data can be precious in optimising your store and marketing strategies. We help you interpret these insights and turn them into actionable plans to grow your business.
