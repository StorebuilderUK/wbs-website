## Accept Payments On The Go - Anytime

For small business owners, it's essential to have a mobile credit card reader so you can accept payments anywhere, anytime. But with**so many options on the market**, it can be hard to know which is right for your business. To help you make the best decision, I've compiled a list of UK mobile credit card readers.
Best Mobile Credit Card Readers

### What Is A Mobile Credit Card Reader?

A mobile credit card reader is a device that allows businesses to accept credit and debit card payments using a smartphone or tablet.
There are many different types of mobile credit card readers available on the market, but they all work in the same way.
You will need to download a corresponding app onto your smartphone or tablet to use a mobile credit card reader. Once you install the App, you can connect your mobile device to the credit card reader via Bluetooth or NFC (near-field communication).
Once the two devices are connected, you begin processing payments. To do this, you will need to enter the purchase amount into the App and then swipe or insert the customer's credit or debit card into the reader.
The funds then get transferred from the customer's account to your business, minus a small processing fee.

## The Benefits Of Using A Mobile Credit Card Reader

Perhaps the most obvious benefit is that it allows you to accept credit and debit card payments without a traditional point-of-sale (POS) system.
Another significant benefit is that mobile credit card readers are usually very affordable, with some costing as little as £20.
Another advantage of using a mobile credit card reader is that it's highly portable, so you can take it wherever you go—ideal for businesses that move around frequently or have pop-up shops.
Finally, mobile credit card readers are elementary to set up and use, so you can start taking payments almost immediately without going through a long and complicated setup process.

### What Are The Different Types Of Mobile Credit Card Readers?

### There are two main mobile credit card reader types: wired and wireless.

#Wired readers connect to your mobile device via a physical cable, such as a USB cable. On the other hand, wireless readers use Bluetooth or NFC to connect to your device.
Wired readers are generally more reliable than wireless readers because there is no risk of losing the connection between the reader and your device. However, wired readers can be less convenient because you need to keep the reader physically attached to your device.
On the other hand, wireless readers are much more convenient to use, but there is a risk of losing the connection between the reader and your device.
