### Wix Editor or Wix ADI?

Use the drag and drop editor if you want total control over the look and feel of your website by adding text boxes, images, and videos and then moving them around your page to create the perfect layout.
You can begin with one of the many templates that Wix offers as a starting point and easily replace the images for a quick start leaving the original layout intact. Alternatively you could opt for a blank canvas but make sure you watch some training videos before opting for this route!
On the other hand, you should choose the Wix ADI (Artificial Design Intelligence) if you want to build a website quickly and easily without having to learn all the Wix layout tools straight off the bat.
With the WIX ADI, you can answer some questions about your business, and Wix will generate a customised website based on your answers to those questions.
The Wix ADI uses advanced algorithms to choose the best template, design, and layout for your needs and then adds the content you provide to it.
Which is the right choice for you? It all depends on your needs and preferences.
If you're a control freak wanting to customise every aspect of your website, go for the Drag and Drop Editor. If you're short on time and want a website up and running quickly, go for the ADI.

## Benefits Of Using Wix For Website Design

### Wix offers several benefits for website design, including:
 ***User-friendly platform:**Wix's platform is easy to use, even for those who have never done any website design before. Its drag-and-drop Editor allows you to design your website quickly and efficiently without writing a line of code.
 ***Wide range of design options:**Wix offers a wide range of design options, including templates, themes, and layouts, to help you create a website that fits your brand and style. Its highly customisable design options allow you to change your website's colours, fonts, and layouts all without having to learn CSS or other programming languages.
 ***Affordable pricing plans:**Wix offers affordable pricing plans that cater to different needs and budgets. Its free plan offers basic features although these are advert supported, while its premium plans offer more advanced features and tools to help you build a more sophisticated website.
 ***Easy integration with third-party tools:**Wix offers easy integration with third-party tools, such as Google Analytics, Mailchimp, and social media platforms, to help you optimise your website's performance and reach.

### How To Get Started With Wix Website Design

### Signing up for a Wix account
To start with Wix, you must sign up for a Wix account. You can sign up for a free account, which gives you access to basic features or choose a premium plan for more advanced features and tools.

## Choosing A Website Template
Here are some things to keep in mind when choosing a template to get started with. Remember that you can't switch templates mid stream which is one of the few Wix drawbacks.
 ***What is your website going to be used for?:**Are you creating a site for your business, blog, or portfolio? Choose a template that fits your site's specific needs. All of the templates are categorised so this won't be a difficult step.
 ***Look for a template with a layout that makes sense for your content:**If you go for a template with a lot of images make sure you have the resources to be able to replace the default ones. Wix has a library of imagfes and also gives you access to Unsplash images but having an account like Shutterstock makes everything a lot easier.
 ***Choose a template that matches your brand**: If you have a specific colour palette, font style, or house style that you want to stick to, choose a template that complements it. It's easy to customise the default theme though so it's not a deal breaker if you can't find the template you like with the right colours.
 ***Check for built-in features:**Many Wix templates include contact forms, social media integrations, and e-commerce capabilities. Consider what features you need for your website and choose a template that includes them.
Remember, the template you choose is the foundation of your website, so take the time to find one that fits your needs and goals.

## Customising The Website Design
If you've never built a website before and you don't have a clue what you are doing it's probably going to be best to watch a few Youtube videos to see how the editor works before getting your fingers dirty!
To add a new element to your website, click on the "Add" button on the left-hand side of the Editor and select the type of element you want to add (e. g. text, image, gallery, etc.).
Once you've selected the element type, you can drag and drop it anywhere on the page. It's good practice to group many elements together to stop them from moving around or make it easier to move many elements at the same time.
There are a couple of tips I can give you here that will make designing in Wix a lot easier. First of all place all of your elements in strips and let those strips control the layout. This will make sure everything displays nicely on mobile devices.
Also, keep everything between the page guides. Wix is mobile adaptive and not mobile responsive, which means elements take up an absolute position, but here I am showing off the height of my nerdiness. Wix has the option to make strips fill the entire screen, which is fine but you should keep text in between the page guides.
And lastly, use the "save to my designs" function to make your strips reusable on any page of your site.

## Adding Content To Your Wix Website
Once you've got the design of your Wix website down, it's time to start adding content which is where things start to come together, and your website begins to take shape.
Thanks to the platform's user-friendly interface, adding content to your Wix website is a breeze. With just a few clicks, you can easily create new pages and add text, images, videos, and other elements.
In addition to Wix's built-in features, plenty of apps and integrations are available to help you add even more content to your site. For example, you can use the blog app to create a dedicated blog section on your website or integrate your social media accounts to display your latest posts and updates.
The key is to take your time and plan out your content strategy before you start adding everything willy-nilly.
Think about what message you want to convey and what information your visitors want, and then craft your content accordingly.
With some creativity and strategic planning, you can create a website that looks great and provides real value to your audience.

### Tips For Designing A Great Wix Website

 ***Use parallax scrolling:**Parallax scrolling is a design technique that creates a sense of depth by moving the background at a different speed than the foreground. It can add that wow factor to your website.
 ***Incorporate animations:**Animations can make your website look more dynamic and exciting, by adding animations to elements such as buttons, text, and images you can create a more interactive experience for your visitors. Don't overdo it though because no one likes to be endlessly distracted by a designer with shiny object syndrome.
 ***Integrate custom code:**If you have some basic coding knowledge, you can integrate custom code into your Wix website to add more advanced features. For example, you could add a custom search bar or a dynamic slider.
 ***Use video backgrounds:**Video backgrounds can create an immersive experience for your visitors and make your website stand out. You can use a looping video as a background for your header or a banner section to create a stunning effect.
 ***Add interactive elements:**Interactive elements such as quizzes, polls, and calculators can make your website more engaging and keep visitors longer. You can use Wix's app market to find these additional features.

## Choose A Visually Appealing Color Scheme
Choosing a suitable colour scheme can make your website stand out. When selecting colours, consider the emotions you want to evoke in your audience.
For example, if you want to create a calming and peaceful atmosphere, you might choose soft blues and greens. On the other hand, if you want to create a bold and energetic vibe, you might go for bright oranges and yellows.
Another tip is to use colour contrast to make certain elements stand out, helping guide your audience's attention to important areas of your website.
For example, use a bright colour for your call-to-action buttons to make them more noticeable.
Finally, feel free to experiment with different colour combinations and patterns.
Consider using a colour scheme generator tool to help you develop unique and visually appealing combinations you might not have thought of otherwise.
Remember to remember your brand and target audience when making your final selections.

### Use High-Quality Images

High-quality images can add a professional touch to your website and give it visual appeal.
Avoid using low-quality or pixelated images, which can make your website look unprofessional. You can use Wix's built-in image editor to crop, resize, and enhance your photos to ensure they look their best on your website but be careful when resizing and use the original image ratio to maintain the integrity of the image.
It's best to use original images you or your team have taken or created adding a unique and personalised touch to your website, use high-quality images that are relevant to your brand and content.
Wix offers several options for importing images into your website. You can upload pictures directly from your computer, import images from your social media accounts, or choose from a free and paid stock image library.
In terms of stock images, Wix partners with several well-known companies such as Shutterstock, Bigstock, and Unsplash to offer a wide selection of high-quality photos for users to choose from.
These images are conveniently integrated into the Wix editor, making searching and adding them to your website easy.
Additionally, Wix offers an AI-powered image optimisation tool that can automatically resize and compress your images for optimal website performance without sacrificing quality, saving you time and ensuring your website runs smoothly and loads quickly.

## Write Create Clear And Concise Content
Here are some practical steps to follow:
 ***Know your audience:**Who are you writing for? What are their needs and interests? Knowing your audience will help you tailor your content to their specific needs and use language that they can easily understand.
 ***Use simple language:**There's no need to use complicated words or industry jargon if it's not necessary. Use simple language that anyone can understand.
 ***Keep it short and sweet:**Long paragraphs can be intimidating and overwhelming. Break up your content into shorter paragraphs and use subheadings to make it easier to read.
 ***Use examples:**Analogies and real-life examples can help make complex ideas easier to understand.
 ***Edit, edit, edit:**After you've written your content, go back and edit it for clarity and conciseness. Remove any unnecessary words or phrases, and make sure your sentences are easy to read.
Remember, the goal is not to dumb down your content or talk down to your audience. The goal is to communicate your ideas in a way that is easy to understand and digest.

> As Albert Einstein famously said, "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."

Let's do our part to make the internet more straightforward and concise. After all, ain't nobody got time for confusing content.

## Blog Post Summary
Having a visually appealing website is essential for any business.
With Wix, you can use their colour scheme generator tool to help you create unique combinations tailored to your brand and target audience.
Use high-quality images on your website and Wix's image editor and stock photo library.
To ensure that your content is concise and easy to understand, know your audience, use simple language, keep it short, provide examples, and edit for clarity.
