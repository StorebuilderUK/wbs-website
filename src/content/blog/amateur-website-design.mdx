# Wix Woes: Unravelling Why Amateurs Struggle with Website Design
 * Mar 27, 2024
**In the vast realm of website builders**and instant drag and drop gratification, Wix stands out as a beacon of empowerment for [_beginner website designers_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/wix-review) and small business owners alike. It's a welcoming space where anyone, regardless of technical prowess, can craft a stunning website with ease.
**_Yes even you too can create your very own "Starry Night" with just a few drag and drop grandiose shimmies of your mouse._**
Interestingly did you know that "Vincent" was written by that guy who also composed that little ditty "American pie" and here's the start of the song to kick it off on replay for your dopamine delight:
**Starry, starry night**
**_Paint your palette blue and gray_**
**_Look out on a summer's day_**
**_With eyes that know the darkness in my soul_**
Starry Night By Vincent Van Gogh
**But what's this?**
As you immerse yourself deeper into the Wix experience, you begin to**encounter some complexities**that you didn't forsee and it begins to dawn on you why all those pimply, underworked, overpaid and incompetently dressed website designers exist to breathe valuable oxygen after all.
The main problem lies with white space, or to put it bluntly, your**lack of white space appreciation**.
Blank pages are meant to be filled with images and text right? Unused white space needs to have the drag and drop shit kicked out of it.
White space is a website designers best friend. being able to**use those blank spaces to maximum effect**is the hallmark of great design. And this is where the problems with amateur hour website design begin.
#### Mastering The Subtleties Of White Space
**Often overlooked by novices**, white space is a cornerstone of effective web design.
It's a misconception that every inch of turf must be filled; in reality, strategic use of white space enhances readability, guides visitors' focus, and contributes to a site's overall aesthetic appeal.
**This principle underscores a critical distinction between amateur efforts and professional web design.**
As one delves deeper into [_website design_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design) nuances, the importance of white space becomes clear, illustrating why skilled designers play a vital role in crafting functional, visually appealing websites.
Mastery of white space usage separates great design from cluttered, ineffective layouts, highlighting a common pitfall for those new to web design.
#### What's So Great About Wix?
Wix is the go-to spot if you're not a tech wizard. It's got this simple way of letting you drag pictures and text around to make your website, and it's packed with designs for all kinds of businesses.
At first, it seems like the best way to let your creative flag fly. But the same things that make people flock to Wix—the easy start, loads of choices, and ways to make your site your own—can also complicate things if you're not quite ready.
People are attracted to Wix (and other drag and drop website builders that entice you to the promised land) because it promises to make web design easy for everyone. With its easy-to-use tools and ready-made designs, creating a website is as simple as putting together a puzzle.
But there's a twist: when you get into the thick of it, there's much more to think about than you might have expected, meaning that what started as a fun project can quickly turn into a mind meltingly, weekend munching, time consuming monster.
#### Getting the Hang of Wix
Getting good at using Wix is more complicated than it first seems. It's great for getting your feet wet in making websites, but the more you play with it, the more you realize there's much to learn.
This mix of easy-to-start but tough-to-master can leave you scratching your head, wondering if Wix is the friendly guide it's made out to be, especially when you are trying to turn your big idea into an actual, good-looking website that can convert browsers into hard cash paying customers.
## Common Pitfalls for Amateur Designers
### Becoming Overwhelmed by Options

Choice, whilst a luxury, can become a formidable barrier. Wix offers many templates and widgets, but this vast selection can lead to decision paralysis. Novices find themselves endlessly scrolling, unable to settle on a design that feels "just right."
### Design Consistency Challenges

Creating a cohesive look across a website requires a keen eye for detail and a steady hand in design—skills that amateurs are still honing. The temptation to mix and match elements from various templates often results in a disjointed aesthetic that bewilders more than it charms.
### SEO Missteps

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is critical for online visibility, yet it remains one of Wix's most misunderstood aspects of web design. Many users inadvertently adopt practices that dampen their website's search engine ranking, such as inadequate keyword usage and insufficient meta descriptions.
### Site Performance Issues

Website speed is crucial for user satisfaction and SEO. Unfortunately, amateur designers often overload their sites with high-resolution images and elaborate animations, not realising the impact on loading times and overall performance.
## Navigating Wix's Limitations
### Customisation Constraints

Although Wix's templates provide a starting point, their inherent limitations can quash creativity. Users frequently need to find time to realise their envisioned design requires compromises, leading to frustration and a sense of confinement within the platform's parameters.
### Learning and Growing Beyond Wix
### Embracing the Learning Curve

The journey from amateur to adept designer is fraught with trials and errors. With all its intricacies, Wix serves as both a mentor and a challenge, urging users to learn about design principles, user experience, and the technicalities of web development.
