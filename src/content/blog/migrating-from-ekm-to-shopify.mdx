### Exporting Key Data from EKM
Now that you're set up on Shopify, it's time to gather your data from EKM.
 ***Products, Customers, and Orders**: In EKM, you can export data such as product listings, customer details, and order history, typically in a CSV format. Make sure this information is complete and well-organised.
 ***Format and Structure Considerations**: Verify that the exported files are compatible with Shopify's import format. Shopify supports CSV files for most data types.
 ***Data Quality Assurance**: Before importing, review your exported data carefully. Clean up any outdated product listings or duplicate information to ensure a fresh start on Shopify.
