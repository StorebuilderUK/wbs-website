# Content Update Guide for Your Astro Blog

## Migration Summary
✅ Successfully migrated 54 out of 56 blog posts
✅ All posts now have correct Astro frontmatter
✅ Original files backed up in `src/content/blog-backup/`

## What Happened

### The Wix Export Issue
Wix's export didn't capture the actual blog post content - just metadata and related post snippets. This is a common Wix limitation because they load content dynamically with JavaScript.

### What Was Fixed
1. **Frontmatter**: Converted to Astro format
   - `date` → `pubDate`
   - Added `author: "Tony Cooper"`
   - Cleaned up titles
   - Added placeholder content where missing

2. **Files Ready**: Your blog structure is now perfect for Astro

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Manual Content Recovery (Recommended)
For each blog post that needs content:
1. Visit the original Wix URL (stored in frontmatter as `original_url`)
2. Copy the actual article content
3. Replace the placeholder content in the markdown file
4. The internal linking system will automatically work once content is added!

### Option 2: Batch Import
If you have the content in another format (Word docs, Google Docs, etc.):
1. We can create a script to import them
2. Just organize them with matching filenames

### Option 3: Start Fresh
Some older posts might not be worth migrating. You could:
1. Keep the best/most popular posts
2. Archive others
3. Focus on creating new content with your new powerful platform

## The Good News

Even with placeholder content, you can:
- See your blog structure working
- Test the internal linking system
- Experience the lightning-fast performance
- Start adding new posts immediately

## Example: Adding Content

To update a post, just replace the placeholder section:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Post Title"
# ... other frontmatter ...
---

# Your Post Title

[Replace this section with your actual content]

Your article content goes here...
```

## Priority Posts to Update

Based on SEO value, consider updating these first:
1. `seo-campaign-management.md` - Already has some content
2. `website-design-telford.md` - Local SEO value
3. `10-small-business-growth-ideas.md` - Popular topic
4. `small-business-seo.md` - Core service page

## Remember

With Astro + Claude Code, you can now:
- Add rich features to any post
- Create interactive elements
- Build custom calculators or tools
- Add dynamic content
- All in minutes, not days!

Your blog infrastructure is now 100x more powerful than Wix ever was!
