## Market Keyword Research And Analysis

We base your SEO campaign on extensive market keyword research and competitor analysis. We'll look at your website's current state and keywords that drive traffic to similar sites to find growth opportunities.

We also perform competitor analysis to see exactly where your brand awareness stands in comparison to the competition.

Target audience analysis helps us determine a realistic timeframe for seeing results and if we need to make any changes before moving forward with SEO-related activities.

Once we have a good understanding of your website and the competitive landscape, it's time to start setting some goals. Our team will work with you to develop achievable, realistic targets through SEO \- such as increasing organic traffic by a certain percentage or boosting conversions by a specific margin.

We'll set up a strategy to help you meet these goals, and then we'll get started. We work hard because our clients deserve the best - so once your campaign is live, we stay diligent in continuing to monitor performance metrics and you'll see this reflected in your monthly SEO report.

## Technical SEO & On-Page Optimisation

No matter how great your website is, if it's not [SEO Optimised for your niche](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/product-page/90-day-seo-plan), you'll have a tough time ranking well. That's why our team focuses on technical SEO and on-page optimisation as part of your overall strategy.

​

We'll ensure that all the necessary elements are in place so that Google (and other search engines) can correctly crawl and index your website.

Ensure page titles, meta descriptions, header tags, and other vital elements are correctly formatted and optimised for the right keywords.

We'll also examine your website's architecture to ensure that it is as user-friendly as possible, reducing bounce rates, increasing conversions, and boosting your overall SEO performance.

​

We'll make changes that will help improve your website's visibility and ranking power so you can see more traffic and higher conversions in a shorter period using a successful SEO strategy.

​

We can also use these insights to create customised reports for clients that show where their strengths and weaknesses lie. 

​

Analysing data includes information on the source of traffic, keyword rankings, click-through rates, social media engagement metrics, and more - all in easy-to-understand graphs designed to simplify data analysis for virtually any type of business owner or manager.
