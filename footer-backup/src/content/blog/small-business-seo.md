[_Search engine optimisation_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/seo-copywriting) (SEO) can help your small business**increase its online visibility**, attract customers, and grow from a small one-man band into a company with PAYE headaches, staff that don't turn up and all the other joyful blessings that come with running your own company.

 
The prospect of investing in SEO may seem overwhelming but the good news is that affordable SEO strategies can help you achieve your goals without breaking the bank. 

 
In this blog post, I will share tips and tricks for [_affordable SEO_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/seo-campaign-management) that can help small business owners like yourself improve your website's search engine rankings, drive more traffic to your website, and ultimately [_grow your business_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/10-small-business-growth-ideas). 

 
Whether you're just starting with SEO or looking for new ways to optimise your website,**these tips and tricks will help you get started on a budget.**

 
## Define Your Target Market 

As a website designer, I can't stress the importance of defining your target market enough. 

 
Knowing who you want to reach with your content will allow you to create a strategy that**speaks directly to those individuals**, increasing your engagement and improving your overall marketing results. 

As I am speaking directly to you now is the way that you should approach [_writing your content_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/become-the-website-copywriting-superhero-your-company-needs).

 
Being crystal clear on the audience you want to engage with your content helps you tailor your messaging and design elements to suit their preferences and establish a stronger connection with them. 

 
When you know your target market well, you can create a well-thought-out strategy that resonates with their needs, desires, and expectations. 

 
This will ultimately lead to increased engagement and better marketing results, as your audience will find your content relevant and appealing. Trust me, investing time and effort in defining your target market is a game changer! 

### Conducting Keyword Research On A Budget

By**targeting the right keywords**, you can attract more traffic to your website, improve your search engine rankings, and, ultimately, boost your bottom line. 

However, keyword research can be costly and time-consuming, often leaving small business owners discouraged. 

Fear not, intrepid reader! There are budget-friendly ways to conduct keyword research that can help you identify valuable keywords without breaking the bank. 

First, let's talk about the free keyword research tools available. Sure, they may not be as fancy as the paid tools, but they can still get the job done. 

Google's [_Keyword Planner_](https://ads.google.com/intl/en_uk/home/tools/keyword-planner/), [_Answer the Public_](https://answerthepublic.com/), and [_Ubersuggest_](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/) are excellent options to help you identify those relevant and popular keywords. 

Don't let their free price tag fool you - these tools can provide valuable insights into search volume, competition, and CPC. 

Another budget-friendly way to conduct keyword research is to mine your website's analytics data. Your website's search query report can provide valuable information about the keywords people use to find your site. 

This can help you identify keywords already working for your business and identify gaps in your keyword strategy.

 * Look to your competitors for inspiration. By analysing the keywords your competitors are targeting, you can identify opportunities to optimise your website's content and attract more traffic. 

 * Tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs can provide valuable insights into your competitors' keyword strategies and help you identify gaps and opportunities. 

## Optimising Website Content For SEO

## 

On-page SEO refers to the techniques used to make your website more search engine-friendly. Here are some tips for optimising website content for SEO:

 * Use title tags and meta descriptions that include your target keywords and accurately describe the content on each page.

 * Use header tags (H1, H2, H3) to structure your content and make it easier for search engines to understand.

 * Write high-quality, informative, and engaging content that satisfies users' search intent and includes your target keywords.

 
## Building Backlinks Without Spending A Lot Of Money 

Backlinks are links from other websites to your website and are an important ranking factor for SEO. However, building backlinks can be time-consuming and expensive if you rely on paid link-building services. 

**Here are some tips for building backlinks on a budget:**

 * Guest blogging: Write high-quality guest posts for relevant blogs or websites in your industry, and include a link to your website in the author bio or body of the post.

 * Broken link building: Find broken links on other websites, and reach out to the site owner or webmaster with a suggestion to replace the broken link with a link to your relevant content.

 * Participate in online communities: Join relevant online forums, communities, or groups, and contribute valuable content or insights. Include a link to your website in your signature or profile.

### Promote Your Content By Sharing Your Blog Posts.

Sharing your best blog posts on other websites or platforms can be a smart strategy for gaining exposure, building your audience, and driving traffic to your website. Although it might seem counter intuitive guest posting is one of the best ways of gaining exposure for your website. 

When you share your best blog posts on other websites, you can tap into new networks and communities that may have yet to discover your content, helping you reach a broader audience and build brand awareness. 

By guest posting on other websites or contributing to online communities, you can also establish yourself as a thought leader in your industry and gain credibility and trust from potential readers and customers. 

Another benefit of [_sharing your best blog posts_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/how-to-design-a-blog-content-planning-schedule) is that you can generate backlinks to your website, improving your website's search engine optimisation (SEO). 

When other websites link to your content, search engines view your website as more authoritative and trustworthy, which can help improve your website's rankings in search engine results pages (SERPs). 

As a result, sharing your best blog posts can be a powerful way to improve your online visibility and attract more organic traffic to your website. 

## Monitoring And Measuring SEO Performance 

You can see how your SEO efforts impact your online visibility and overall business goals by [_monitoring your website's search engine rankings_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/your-introduction-to-google-analytics), organic traffic, and other vital metrics. 

 
This information can help you adjust your strategies to achieve better results and make informed decisions about future investments in SEO.

 
By tracking your competitors' SEO performance, you can identify areas where they outperform you and adjust your strategies accordingly, helping you improve your search engine rankings, attract more organic traffic, and, ultimately, stay competitive in your industry.

 
### What Metrics to Track

To effectively monitor and measure SEO performance, it's important to track the right metrics. Some of the most important metrics to track include:

 
 1. Search engine rankings: This metric tracks your website's ranking on search engine results pages (SERPs) for specific keywords and phrases.

 2. Organic traffic: This metric tracks the number of visitors to your website who found your site through organic search results.

 3. Click-through rate (CTR): This metric tracks the percentage of people who clicked on your website's link in the search results compared to the total number of impressions.

 4. Bounce rate: This metric tracks the percentage of visitors who left your website after viewing only one page.

 5. Conversion rate: This metric tracks the percentage of visitors who completed a desired action on your website, such as filling out a form or making a purchase. 

### How to Improve SEO Performance

Improving SEO performance requires a combination of technical and content optimisation strategies. 

 
Here are some tips to improve your SEO performance:

 1. Conduct keyword research and optimise your website's content for relevant keywords.

 2. Build high-quality backlinks to your website from other reputable sites.

 3. Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and has a fast page load speed.

 4. Create high-quality content that provides value to your target audience.

 5. Monitor and improve user experience on your website.

In conclusion, monitoring and measuring SEO performance is essential for any business looking to improve its online visibility and attract more organic traffic. 

By tracking the right metrics and implementing effective optimisation strategies, you can improve your search engine rankings, drive more traffic to your website, and, ultimately, grow your business into the headache plagued, stress inducing monster it is supposed to be.
