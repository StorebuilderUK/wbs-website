# The Harsh Truth: You Are The Reason Your Marketing Isn’t Working

 * Mar 27

##**Why Your Marketing Fails: The Person in the Mirror**

I recently completed the "[_Good 2 Great_](https://good-2-great.co.uk/) " business course, funded by Telford Council (Thank you for all your help [_Nick Bastock)_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-bastock-22a80721a/) and, after networking with many start-ups and new businesses, the experience reinforced a brutal truth many business owners shy away from: the primary reason your marketing isn’t working, is you.

If you find yourself using phrases like,_"I don't have time for marketing"_only to later say,_"I don't have enough customers"_? Then, the solution could lie closer to home than you might think.

Because here's the**uncomfortable truth**:**you are the reason your marketing isn't working.**

It's not just the algorithm, the economy, or that_"marketing doesn't work for my business."_

**It's you.**

This might be painful to accept, but thankfully, if you are the problem,**you also hold the solution.**

Let's dig into the common reasons your marketing may be stalling and how to get it back on track.

###**1\. You’re Not Too Busy – You’re Just Avoiding It**

> "It's not enough to be busy; so are the ants. The question is, what are we busy about?" - Henry David Thoreau

"Too busy" has become everyone's default answer for why something doesn't get done; however, if we're honest with ourselves "too busy" is really just a code phrase for "let's avoid it right now."

One of the reasons people avoid marketing is because it can feel uncomfortable, unfamiliar and even a little salesy...

You can combat this feeling by finding a client's pain points and making genuine efforts to solve them.

Put yourself in a potential customer's shoes and consider how you can help them. For instance, while I wrote this blog post, I always kept in mind clients (both new and current) who would benefit from reading it.

You can also make marketing an exciting thing you look forward to, instead of another chore, by genuinely helping people solve their problems.

###**2\. If You Don’t Make Time, You’ll Keep Wasting Time**

You think you’re saving time by not marketing, but you’re losing_far more_of it by constantly chasing the same customers, dealing with slow sales, or wondering why it’s so quiet. Not to mention the stress of low turnover, worrying about cash flow problems and paying the bills.**Is that you?**

In the past, I used to spend days tweaking my website, adding more products, trying to improve my offers, and generally doing anything I could to avoid what you could call "marketing." Days turned into weeks, weeks into months, months into years.

It was only when I dropped the self-conscious feeling of not being good enough that I realised shamelessly promoting your products or services is a far more preferable way to go than dying a slow death in a vacuum of silence.

There will always be someone who does it better than you; there will always be someone who knows more. The key is to act. Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.

>**"Sales fixes everything in a business. You have a marketing problem? Sales. Product problem? Sales. Operational problem? Sales." - Alex Hormozi**

I'm not a fan of [_Alex Hormzoi's_](https://www.acquisition.com/bio-alex) shorts and beard act, but when he remarked that "if you don't have sales, then you don't have a business," I sat up and listened. That remark changed everything for me. Without sales, you can't have a business.

**15 minutes a day**can make a massive difference if you use it well. A social media post. A quick email to past customers. Updating your Google Business listing. Small, regular actions add up over time.

###**3\. You’re Waiting for the Perfect Plan – and Wasting Precious Days**

Here’s another hard truth: perfection is just procrastination in a fancy coat.

If you’re waiting for the perfect strategy, website, or brand voice… you’ll be waiting forever. In the meantime, your audience will forget you exist.

Marketing doesn’t need to be perfect.**It needs to be consistent**.

Just start. Post something. Write a short blog. Share a photo of what you’re working on. Show up.

**Done is better than perfect**—especially when the alternative is silence.

###**4\. You Say Marketing Doesn’t Work – But You Haven’t Tried Enough**

People who try posting on social media a few times and don't get enough sales will say things like, "Social media doesn't work". That's like going to the gym for one day and expecting to lose 15 pounds!

Marketing is a long game because building awareness, trust, and engagement takes time (and repeat exposure). If you only put out one ad, one social media post, or anything else once,_it won't work!_

You must be consistent for the magic sauce to start working (and_you_are the chef).

I've lost count of how many times I've sent out this newsletter, only to receive a new enquiry a day or two later. It's human nature for people to need to see your business multiple times before they act.

**The drip, drip, drip effect works.**

###**5\. You Are the Brand – Like It or Not**

People buy from people; they aren't just purchasing a faceless product or service. They want to know who they're doing business with and why you're doing what you're doing.

So, if you're merely relying on hiding behind your logo and hoping that customers will magically discover you, then you're missing the whole point:

**The story and voice****_you_****bring is your biggest marketing asset!**

There's no need to be an influencer. Just show up by being yourself (and add value, of course!)

###**6\. Practical Ways to Get Started (Even If You’re ‘Too Busy’)**

Still with me? Good. Here’s the part where we ditch the excuses and get practical.

Try this:

 ***Block out 30 minutes a week**to focus on marketing. Put it in your diary and treat it like an appointment.

 ***Pick one platform**and show up consistently. Don’t try to do everything—do one thing well.

 ***Repurpose content.**A blog post becomes a few social media posts. A photo becomes a Facebook story. One idea = many uses.

 ***Use tools.**[_Canva for visuals_](https://www.canva.com/en_gb/), [_Buffer_](https://buffer.com/) or [_Content Studio_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/content-studio-review) for scheduling, and [_ChatGPT_](https://chatgpt.com/) for writing help—these tools will save you hours.

 ***Delegate.**If you hate marketing or just won’t do it, get someone else to do it for you.

###**7\. The Harder Truth: If You Won’t Do It, Someone Else Will**

Your competitors are out there making noise, closing sales, and building an audience_while_you're sitting there wondering about possibly posting something.

They aren't better, they're just more_visible!_

**Therefore, visibility is the only difference. If you stay invisible, then your business will remain invisible!**

###**Own It or Stay Stuck**

**You may be the reason your marketing isn’t working,**but that also means you have the power to change it.

You don’t need a fancy marketing degree. You don’t need to spend thousands on ads. You just need to stop waiting and start showing up.

Just do one thing to promote your business...

... and then do that thing again tomorrow.

Because marketing will_only_work if and when you do.
