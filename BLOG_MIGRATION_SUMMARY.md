# Blog Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated and cleaned up 40+ blog posts from the original We Build Stores website to the new Astro-based site.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Image Mapping (18 posts fixed)
Corrected blog post images that were incorrectly mapped during import:
- Working-From-Home image → beyond-pyjamas.jpg
- Harsh-Truth image → marketing-harsh-truth.jpg
- AI-themed images properly assigned to AI posts
- Wix-specific images for Wix tutorials
- eCommerce images for shop-related posts

### 2. Category Fixes (39 posts updated)
Replaced generic "seo" category with appropriate categories:
- **AI**: 7 posts about artificial intelligence and automation
- **Wix**: 10 posts about Wix platform and tutorials
- **eCommerce**: 7 posts about online stores and selling
- **Marketing**: 6 posts about marketing strategies
- **Business**: 4 posts about business growth
- **Website Design**: 3 posts about design principles
- **Design**: 1 post about design services
- **Technology**: 1 post about tech topics

### 3. Duplicate H1 Headings (38 posts fixed)
Removed duplicate H1 headings that were causing SEO issues since the template already renders the title as H1.

### 4. Title & Date Remnants (20 posts cleaned)
Removed imported title and date remnants that appeared after hero images, cleaning up the content flow.

## Blog Structure

### Current Setup
- **Location**: `/src/content/blog/`
- **Format**: MDX files with frontmatter
- **Images**: Stored in `/src/assets/images/blog/`
- **Utility**: `blog-images.ts` for image mapping
- **Template**: Individual blog post template at `/src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro`

### Frontmatter Schema
```yaml
title: "Post Title"
description: "Post description for SEO"
pubDate: "YYYY-MM-DD"
category: "category-slug"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
heroImage: "image-slug" or "https://external-url"
originalUrl: "https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/original-slug"
```

## External Images Still in Use
Some posts still use external Wix-hosted images:
- advanced-wix-website-design.mdx
- how-to-painlessly-transfer-your-wordpress-website-to-wix.mdx
- uk-shopify-shipping.mdx
- multi-channel-selling.mdx
- small-business-growth-made-easy.mdx
- your-169-pathway-to-success.mdx

These can be downloaded and localized if needed for better performance and control.

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Download and localize remaining external images
2. Add read time estimates to blog posts
3. Implement related posts algorithm based on tags/categories
4. Add social sharing buttons
5. Create category pages for browsing posts by topic

## Technical Notes
- All blog posts now have proper SEO-friendly structure
- Images are optimized through Astro's Image component
- Categories and tags are properly structured for future filtering
- Original URLs preserved for potential redirects
