You might be familiar with the adage, "**_I don't know what I want, but I'll recognise it when I see it?"_**

  

If you ask a Graphic Designer if this ideology is seen in graphic design and just how often the work complies with the respective client's design brief (or lack thereof), their response might surprise you.

  

Some Designers will tell you that work/design brief compliance is a 50/50 split, but others will tell you it seldom happens. Some graphic designers suggest that disparity between the work and the design brief is the norm rather than the exception.

**WE ASKED OUR DESIGN TEAM**

We posed the following question to our [_graphic design team_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/graphic-design) : on average, how close is the finished design to the specifications outlined by the client in the design brief? The responses ranged from "Only if the client provides a sketch or sample" to "What design brief? (referencing the Spartan nature of some briefs) to "Rarely happens, if ever".

**BEING A LOGO CLIENT CAN BE HARD (for the client)**

_Honest designers will sympathise with this predicament!_

  

If making things easy sounds like designer cynicism towards the client, honest designers will tell you that it is not because they (designers) realise the predicament of a client who is paying money (in some but not all cases) to produce and deliver something that they (the client) hasn't seen. Who could be envious of that problem? Indeed, not a designer because they are acutely aware of this dilemma, and this is where the adage "I don't know what I want, but I'll recognise it when I see it" is best served by referring clients to[ _PRE-MADE Logos and Podcast Cover-Art._](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/pre-made-logos-1)

  

**IDENTIFY LIKES AND DISLIKES**

Our PRE-MADE logos and Podcast cover-art designs are wide-ranging enough (we're adding new ones all the time) for a potential client to pinpoint a design they like, and we simply have to edit the titles and colours before handing over the project files. Files that comply with industry standards (EPS, PDF, PNG, JPG and master vectors)

  

If, however, the client only likes specific elements from one design but doesn't like the whole thing or would like to combine elements from one design with another, we can do that too, and in doing so, the client will have a better idea of how things will turn out, so they (the client) won't have to work so hard trying to explain to a bubblehead designer what they (the client) is looking for

  

Clarity and ease of communication are other reasons why our [ _PRE-MADE logo and PODcast Cover-Art_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/pre-made-logos-1) selections can be helpful (to clients and our designers alike). They separate amateurs from pros. It's no good building a website that doesn't convert. You might not have started in the first place!
