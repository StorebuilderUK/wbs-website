# Can AI Produce Authentic Python, Django and React.js Code?

## The age of "vibe coding" is here. But here's what most business owners don't understand about building apps with AI.

  

I've been building websites and business tools for over 20 years. Flash animations, responsive design, jQuery to React.js - I've seen every trend come and go. But what's happening with AI coding tools right now? **This is different**.

  

Last month, I built the foundations of my "Business Growth Plan" in four weeks from start to a working production version. 

  

No computer science degree. No years learning syntax. Just clear instructions and a solid understanding of what a modern business website needs.

  

Here's the thing, though - I almost failed spectacularly and burnt my codebase to the ground. 

  

I succeeded through perseverance. Here are the lessons I learnt along the way.

###   

### The "Vibe Coding" Revolution

"Vibe coding" is the term for this new reality where you describe what you want in plain English and AI writes the actual code. It's like having a developer who never sleeps, never gets frustrated, and costs a fraction of the cost of traditional development.

  

But here's the kicker - it only works if you know how to give instructions. You have to be the one who controls the robot. You have to be the conductor, and you also need to know when to wave the magic wand in the right places.

  

### Why Most People Get This Wrong

Here's what I've learned after six months experimenting with AI coding tools:

  

**The AI isn't psychic.** It builds exactly what you tell it to build, not what you think you told it to build.

  

**The real skill isn't coding anymore - it's communication.**

But not casual communication. You need to write like a project manager, not chat like you're ordering coffee.

  

**I now create three documents before any AI coding project:**

**planning.md** \- Defines exactly what we're building, who it's for, and what success looks like. Your project brief keeps the AI focused on the actual goal.

**task.md** \- Breaks down work into specific, measurable chunks. Instead of "build a user system," I write "create user registration with email validation, password requirements (8+ characters, one number), and automatic email confirmation."

**roadmap.md** \- Maps out development phases so the AI doesn't try building everything at once. Version 1.0 gets basic functionality. Version 1.1 adds the nice-to-haves.

  

This isn't bureaucracy - it's survival. The clearer your documentation, the better your results.

  

**But here's the crucial part most people miss - you need to force the AI to read everything before it starts coding.**

  

I create a dedicated "project" in ChatGPT or [Claude.ai](http://Claude.ai) and upload all three documents. Then I make the AI confirm it's read and understood each one before writing a single line of code.

  

My project notes then say "Always read planning.md, task.md, and roadmap.md. Tell me what we're building, what phase we're in, and what specific task you're about to work on. Don't write any code until you've confirmed this."

  

It sounds excessive, but it prevents hours of wasted work. The AI needs context, not just commands.

  

**Here's another critical rule: Start a fresh chat for every new feature.**

I learned this the hard way. After 50+ messages in a single conversation, the AI starts forgetting earlier decisions and contradicting itself. You'll ask it to perform a simple task, and suddenly it's rewriting your entire database structure.

  

Keep conversations focused. One chat = one feature. Reference your project documents each time, but keep the conversation scope narrow. Your future self will thank you when debugging six months later.

  

### One Tool to Rule Them All

There are many AI coding platforms springing up and I _chose_[ ](http://choseWindsurf.ai)[**_Windsurf.ai_**](http://Windsurf.ai) \- This isn't just another AI chatbot spitting out code snippets. It's a complete development environment that understands your entire project. 

  

Here's what makes it special: Windsurf reads your existing codebase, understands how different files connect, and makes changes across multiple files simultaneously while keeping everything in sync. When I'm building a Django backend with a React frontend, [_Windsurf.ai_](http://Windsurf.ai) is aware that changing the API endpoint also requires updating the frontend calls.

  

The interface feels like working with a senior developer who never gets tired. You can say "add user authentication to this project" and it will create the backend models, build the frontend forms, set up the routing, and even update your database migrations - all while maintaining your existing code style and architecture.

  

Most importantly, it doesn't just dump code and disappear. It explains what it's doing, shows you the connections between files, and helps you understand the decisions it's making. You're learning as you build, not just copying and pasting blindly.

  

### The Real Question: Authentic Code?

Can AI produce "authentic" code? Let me be honest - that's the wrong question.

  

The right question is: **Can AI produce code that solves your business problem reliably?**

  

And the answer is absolutely yes.

  

I've deployed AI-generated Python applications that process SEO audits, Django backends that securely handle client data, and React interfaces that convert prospects into customers.

  

In all cases, the code works, it's maintainable, and it gets built in a fraction of the time.

  

### What This Means for Your Business

**Small business owners:** You can now build custom tools without hiring a full development team. But you need to invest time learning how to communicate with AI effectively.

  

**E-commerce businesses:** Custom inventory systems, automated customer service tools, and personalised marketing platforms are now within reach for hundreds of pounds instead of tens of thousands.

  

**Service businesses:** Client portals, booking systems, and project management tools can be built and deployed in days, not months.

  

### The Hidden Cost Nobody Talks About

Here's the uncomfortable truth - AI coding isn't free money.

  

You'll spend weeks learning to prompt effectively. You'll rebuild features multiple times when the AI misunderstands your requirements. You'll need someone who understands enough about technology to spot when the AI is heading down the wrong path.

  

At We Build Stores, I now spend 30% of my time on AI tool management and prompt engineering. It's a new skill set that sits between business analysis and technical architecture.

  

But the results? Our development speed has tripled, our costs have halved, and we're building better solutions for our clients.

  

### Getting Started (Without the Expensive Mistakes)

**Start small.** Don't try building your entire business platform on day one. Build a simple calculator, a contact form, or a basic data display first.

  

**Write requirements like you're talking to a junior developer.** Be specific about inputs, outputs, and edge cases. "Build me a login system" becomes "Build me a login system that requires email and password, validates email format, stores user data securely, and redirects to a dashboard page after successful login."

  

**Test everything.** AI-generated code can have subtle bugs that only appear under specific conditions. Build testing into your process from day one.

  

**Have an exit strategy.** Know how you'll maintain and modify the code when (not if) your requirements change.

  

### The Bottom Line

Can AI produce authentic code? Here's what I know after deploying my AI-built _system._

  

**AI is already producing enterprise-level code.** The Python applications processing our SEO audits handle thousands of requests without breaking. The Django backends managing client data pass security audits. The React frontends are converting prospects into paying customers.

  

But here's what really matters - this enterprise-quality code gets built in hours, not months.

What used to require a team of developers over 12 weeks now happens in a long weekend. The businesses embracing this shift are building competitive moats while their competitors are still interviewing developers.

  

The ones that ignore it? They'll be paying 10x more for development while moving 10x slower. That's not sustainable in any market.

  

### Ready to Explore What's Possible?

I'm currently helping clients implement AI-powered solutions that would have cost Â£50,000+ to build traditionally. These tools are creating real competitive advantages and measurable ROI.

  

If you're curious about what's possible for your specific situation, let's have a conversation. No sales pitch - just an honest discussion about where AI coding makes sense for your business and where it doesn't.

Because here's the thing - the future isn't about whether AI can code. It's about whether you'll be ready when your competitors start using it.
