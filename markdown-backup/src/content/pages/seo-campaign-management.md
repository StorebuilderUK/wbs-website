## What is SEO Campaign Management?

A managed SEO campaign is a holistic and customised approach to search engine optimisation. Unlike other SEO services that offer pre-packaged and one-size-fits-all solutions, we tailor a managed SEO campaign as an ongoing process to the client's specific needs. 

​

We identify the most effective keywords, optimise website content, build links, and track results.

A managed SEO campaign includes reputational management, social media marketing, and pay-per-click advertising. Ultimately, a managed SEO campaign provides an all-inclusive approach to improving online visibility and driving traffic to a website.

​

A managed SEO campaign aims to increase the quantity and quality of traffic to a site from organic search results. 

​

The first step in launching a managed SEO campaign is to conduct a website audit to identify on-page optimisation opportunities, technical issues, and other factors that could be impeding the site's visibility.

Once the audit is complete, the SEO management team will develop and implement a customised strategy to address the identified issues. 

​

The SEO strategy will optimise the website for both search engine crawlers and users. On-page optimisation efforts may include:

​

  * Improving titles and meta descriptions.

  * Adding relevant keywords throughout the site.

  * Increasing the number of backlinks and improving the site's overall structure and navigation.

​

Off-page optimisation activities may include developing an outreach program to build relationships with high-quality websites and influencers and creating compelling content that encourages users to share links to the site across social media. 

A managed SEO campaign is an effective way to improve the visibility of a website on search engines.
