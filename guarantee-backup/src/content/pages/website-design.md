## The Importance of Planning Your Web Design

 
Careful planning is one of the most important aspects of any web design project conducted by a website designer. This means taking the time to understand your business, your target audience, and what you hope to achieve with your website.

 
Having a good idea of your website's budget is also essential before you start planning. This will help you focus on the most critical features and avoid overspending on unnecessary extras.

### How To Build An eCommerce Website – Project Management Guide

## ​

The more people involved in an eCommerce website builder project, the harder it is to get the project across the line on deadline day. Once multiple stakeholders and their egos' are involved, expertly managing the project becomes essential.

## The Essential Features of a Great Website

There are several essential features that all website designs should include. Here are some of the most important:

​

 * A clear and concise homepage that sums up what your website is about

 * Easy-to-use navigation so visitors can find what they're looking for quickly and easily

 * Well-organised content that is easy to read and understand- A professional design that looks good and represents your business well

 * A contact form or email address so visitors can get in touch with you easily

 * Social media icons to help promote your website on popular social networks

​

### How Much Does A Website Cost?

 
The answer, of course, depends on many factors, including the size and complexity of the project, the level of web design and development required, and whether or not you will be providing the content and copywriting 

 
That said, there are some general price ranges you can expect to pay:

 * A basic web design that includes a simple homepage layout and contact form starts from around £500

 * A business website design using a content management system with several different pages and images starts from around £1,000

 * A professional website with a custom design and lots of development work (including complex features like eCommerce websites) can cost upwards of £10,000
