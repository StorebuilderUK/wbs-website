## Do You Need Help To Start Or Improve Your Pay Per Click (PPC) Campaign?

​

Use a tried-and-tested marketing formula, better known as the AIDA framework, to get attention, stoke your visitor's interest, create a desire, and finally prompt them into action.

​

### Here Is How This Proven Marketing Technique Works:

First, you grab your visitors attention (with an eye-catching headline). You build interest (by explaining what they can expect from reading your ad), then create desire (by showing them why they should click on your ad) and finally ask them to take action (and provide a link or button that makes it easy).

This simple formula has been used successfully in advertising for decades because it works! It will work for you too if you use it correctly.

​

### Expert Tips For Your PPC Campaigns.

​

Here are some great tips on making each step of the PPC marketing campaign process more effective so that people read what you have written and take action when prompted.

 * Use short sentences – long paragraphs are intimidating and difficult to read. Make sure every sentence is relevant – don’t waste time writing about things that aren’t important.

 * Use bullet points instead of entire paragraphs whenever possible Include lots of images or video where appropriate.

 * Make sure everything looks good visually - no one wants to look at ugly ads!

 * Don't forget about mobile users - more people now access the internet via their phones, so make sure your ads look good on mobile devices as well as a desktop PC.

### Why Use Pay Per Click Advertising?

As a small business owner, you've probably given some thought to paid search advertising. You might have even used local SEO services like Google AdWords or Facebook ads to help get the word out about your business.

One of the most effective ways to reach consumers online is through pay-per-click (PPC) advertising.

For small businesses, a great PPC strategy can be a cost-effective way to gain more exposure for your company. Here are some key benefits of PPC advertising that you should know about before getting started:

###

You'll Get More Targeted Traffic.

When you set up an ad campaign with Google, you can choose which keywords will make your ads appear when consumers conduct certain searches on Google and other search engines like Yahoo! and Bing. You can also market your content on platforms like Instagram.

​

By targeting only relevant keywords, you can ensure that your ads will reach those most likely to become customers.

###

Easily Measurable Results

PPC advertising allows you to measure the performance of your campaigns by tracking how much traffic and CTR is driven to your website or landing page through various keywords and search terms. You'll also see which keywords help convert visitors into loyal customers through measurable online advertising.

###

PPC Is Easy To Set Up

Since Google AdWords has made PPC advertising so accessible, it's no wonder that more business owners are trying out this method of paid-for advertising. Thanks to the platform's straightforward interface, even novice web users can create effective search ads without special skills or training.

###

Comprehensive Campaign Tracking.​

If you advertise with multiple PPC platforms, including AdWords and Facebook Ads, you'll be able to compare results across different campaigns.

​

For example, if one of your campaigns delivers higher click-through rates than another, it's clear that this is the keyword or search term to focus more time or budget. You can use tools like Google Analytics to help you measure clicks and conversions.

​

### It's Relatively Cost-Effective.​

Compared to other forms of paid-for advertising, PPC is generally inexpensive. You'll only pay when someone clicks on your ad or visits your website, so your spending will depend on how much traffic you receive from the search engine results pages.
