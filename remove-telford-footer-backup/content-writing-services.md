​A headline is the most crucial part of any blog post, article, or [social media ](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/social-media-plans)update. It's what tells the reader what the piece is about and entices them to read on. A good headline can make or break an article; a great headline will ensure it gets clicked, shared, and read.

The answer is simple: you need to understand what your audience wants and needs to know.
