## Experienced Shopify Developers

When you're ready to start designing your Shopify website, choosing an experienced designer in Shopify development is crucial.

At We Build Stores, we have a team of Shopify experts who can help you create a beautiful Shopify website that is easy to use and helps you sell more products. 

We are confident your website will be as brilliant as your business by sprinkling some of your magic personality dust into your website content.

Here is an outline of the Shopify website creation process

### ​

### 1\. Initial Consultation

The first step is an initial consultation with the store owner to discuss their needs and vision for their shop. This is where the designer will better understand what the shop owner is looking for and determine the type of shop best suited for their business.

​

### 2\. Shopify Theme Selection

Once the store owner has decided on the type of shop they want, the next step is to select a Shopify theme, including an off-the-shelf theme, from the Shopify theme store. There are many Shopify themes to choose from, so it's essential to choose one that will fit the shop's products and style.

​

### 3\. Creating The Shop

The next step is creating the shop. Our designers will start working on the shop's layout, design, and functionality. 

They will also add products, create pages, and set up shipping and payment options.

​

### 4\. Testing & Launch

Once the shop is complete, it's time to test everything and make sure it works correctly. The designer will work with the shop owner to test the shop and make necessary changes. Once everything is perfect, the shop can be launched and begin selling products online.
