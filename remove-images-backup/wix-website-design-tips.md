# Wix Website Designer Shares Ideas To Build A Beautiful Website

 * Dec 2, 2022

**_The Wix website builder is easy to use, but like any software tool, it can take a while to learn and master some of the more advanced concepts._**

In this blog post, I'm sharing ten of my best [_Wix website design_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/wix-website-design) tips and ideas that will save you a lot of stress and hours of [_website development_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-development) time.

## 

## Use Strips To Manage Your Layout

## 

Strips are the building blocks of a Wix web design and make it easy to manage your layout. 

You can add and group text, images, video or any other Wix element into strips and move them around as needed. You can also divide strips into columns to add interest to your website design layout. 

Using strips to manage your [_website design_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/website-design) will ensure that rogue elements do not destroy your perfectly crafted page layout. 

When you add a strip to a page, mouse on the page itself to attach the strip to the page and then you can drag and drop it to butt up against the uppermost strip without leaving any space between them.**Perfect layouts every time**. 

Be careful not to accidentally hide a strip on the page by making space for it on the page first, and use the Wix editor "Tools>Layers" command to inspect the page for undesired web design elements.

## 

## Make Use Of "My Designs" For Repeating Elements

## 

**The "My Designs" feature**on Wix is a great way to save time when creating multiple pages with similar layouts or reusing strip designs on other pages. 

You can use this feature to create a template for a page and then reuse it later when you need to make similar pages. A little known Wix website design feature is that you can reuse designs across all of the sites in your Wix account, which is a huge time saver.

## 

## Fill Strips With Background Images For Stunning Effects

One of the problems with most website [_graphic design_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/graphic-design) tools is the lack of "on-the-fly" image manipulation. However, that's not a problem with Wix! 

Rather than inserting a large image into a strip, you can use the image as a background fill to automatically scale and resize according to the strip size displayed. 

This way, you get glorious full-width images that don't lose resolution when resized for different devices.

## Use The Customisable Site Theme To Maintain Colour Consistency

The Wix editor doesn't use CSS (cascading style sheets) to maintain the site colours and font choices on a website. Instead, it uses a customisable colour palette with**point-and-click functionality**. 

Even though you can choose the colour you want for a font from the palette, it's good practice to detail the hex codes in a site spreadsheet for future reference. 

The customisable site theme means you can say goodbye to learning how to deal with CSS class selectors, and it's straightforward to define heading and text styles.

## Put Your Repeating Elements In The Header And Footer

Use the header and footer sections of a Wix website design to include all the repeating elements throughout your pages. 

These are site navigation, contact details, [_social media_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/social-media-plans) links, and other notable information related to your brand or business that you must repeat across multiple Wix pages. 

It's good practice to include as much of this information in the header and footer sections of a Wix website so that it's always visible to visitors. 

The drawback to including information in the header and footer is that it displays on every page of the website, and there currently needs to be a way to make stand-alone pages. So bear this in mind if you want to [_create landing pages_](https://www.webuildstores.co.uk/post/facebook-lead-generation) with fewer links than standard ones.

## Add Interaction With Hover Effects

A Wix hover effect is an animation that occurs when a user moves their mouse pointer over an element on the page,**adding extra visual interest**and further engaging users with your Wix website. 

You can use hover effects for buttons, images, text elements and more via the settings menu for each element. 

The trick here is to make sure that you test out all the hover effects you've added before publishing your Wix website. This way, you can ensure that everything works as expected and looks professional. 

Just remember, Wix website design isn't just about visual appeal. It's also about the user experience and ensuring visitors have a great time visiting your site. Using superior Wix website design techniques like these, you can ensure that your Wix site looks professional and functions flawlessly!

## Add House Style Fonts Effortlessly 

The fonts available on Wix are extensive, and adding fonts to your website is effortless. You can be sure your site looks consistent with the branding of your business or organisation by uploading Google fonts or fonts from other sources. 

You can upload fonts in TTF, OTF, WOFF2 or WOFF formats, so if you use an unusual font style or a client requests you use their house style, then sleep easy because Wix has you covered!

## Make Use Of The Many Wix Blog Features 

Wix offers a range of features for managing and customising blogs. You can easily add articles, manage comments, schedule posts and choose from multiple layout options. You can set up subscriber notifications whenever you publish new content on your Wix website. 

What I love about the Wix blog is being able to individually select blog posts to display on a page using the "my designs" feature described above. Also, you can configure the blog module in multiple ways, and for this website, I have it running across the bottom of the site as the top part of the footer.

## Wix Mobile Optimisation Tool 

The mobile optimisation tool in Wix allows you to quickly and easily create a mobile version of your Wix website design that looks great on any device. It's simple to use with just two clicks, and all the elements on the Wix website adjust automatically for perfect viewing on mobile devices. 

It also helps you configure page elements like buttons, images, text boxes and more so that they look appealing and work properly on smartphones, tablets or other mobile devices. Allowing visitors to have an enjoyable browsing experience no matter what device they are viewing it on.

## Wix Site Version History

**Made a boo-boo?**Want to restore your site? The Wix site version history allows you to do just that! 

This feature allows you to track any changes made to your Wix website, including the date and time you made the change, making it easy to undo mistakes or restore a Wix page version without starting from scratch. It's also beneficial for efficiently managing different versions of Wix formatted pages. 

As well as a site history, there is also an option for a "release candidate" so that you can make a newer version of your website and release it to a select group of people to preview before making it "live". 

By utilising some of the design tricks and techniques I've outlined in this post, you can create a Wix website that is visually appealing and effective at driving conversions. 

Remember, when it comes to website design, less is often more.
